## Retrieval Performance Test Optimization

### Problem Fixed
The retrieval performance test was inefficiently rebuilding expensive data structures for each query:
1. **Graph-PIR**: Building k-NN graph for every query (very expensive)
2. **PIR-RAG**: Performing k-means clustering for every query (expensive)
3. **System Setup**: Setting up systems twice (redundant)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed Redundant System Setup in `comprehensive_experiment.py`
**Before**: Systems were set up twice
- Once in `run_retrieval_performance_experiment()` 
- Again in `test_retrieval_performance()`

**After**: Setup only happens once in `test_retrieval_performance()`

#### 2. Pre-built Graph for Graph-PIR Simulation
**Before**: `_simulate_graph_pir_search()` called `_build_simple_graph()` for every query
**After**: Graph is built once during setup and reused for all queries

#### 3. Pre-computed Clustering for PIR-RAG Simulation  
**Before**: `_simulate_pir_rag_search()` performed k-means clustering for every query
**After**: Clustering is computed once during setup and reused for all queries

#### 4. Enhanced Setup Logging and Parameter Handling
- Added clear logging about single setup per system
- Added parameter passing for configurable cluster counts
- Clarified that all queries run against the same pre-computed structures

### Performance Benefits
1. **Dramatically faster execution**: No per-query graph building or clustering
2. **Realistic testing**: Mirrors real-world usage where expensive setup happens once
3. **Better benchmarking**: More accurate timing measurements (only query time, not setup time)
4. **Resource efficiency**: Massive reduction in memory and computation overhead
5. **Scalable testing**: Can now test with many queries without prohibitive overhead

### Technical Details

#### Graph-PIR Optimization:
- **Before**: O(n²) graph building per query → O(k × n²) total for k queries  
- **After**: O(n²) graph building once → O(n²) total for any number of queries
- **Speedup**: ~k×faster for k queries (e.g., 50× faster for 50 queries)

#### PIR-RAG Optimization:
- **Before**: O(n × d × c) clustering per query → O(k × n × d × c) total
- **After**: O(n × d × c) clustering once → O(n × d × c) total  
- **Speedup**: ~k×faster for k queries

### Usage
The retrieval performance test now:
1. Pre-computes expensive data structures once per system
2. Runs all queries against the same pre-computed structures  
3. Measures both retrieval quality and PIR performance accurately
4. Provides realistic performance metrics

This matches real-world deployment where PIR systems are set up once with pre-built indices and serve many queries efficiently.

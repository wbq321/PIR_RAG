## Retrieval Performance Test Optimization

### Problem Fixed
The retrieval performance test was inefficiently setting up the database/system for each query, which is unrealistic and wasteful.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed Redundant Setup in `comprehensive_experiment.py`
**Before**: Systems were set up twice
- Once in `run_retrieval_performance_experiment()` 
- Again in `test_retrieval_performance()`

**After**: Setup only happens once in `test_retrieval_performance()`

#### 2. Enhanced Setup Logging in `test_retrieval_performance.py`
- Added clear logging about single setup per system
- Added parameter passing for configurable cluster counts
- Clarified that all queries run against the same setup

### Performance Benefits
1. **Faster execution**: No redundant setup operations
2. **Realistic testing**: Mirrors real-world usage where setup happens once
3. **Better benchmarking**: More accurate timing measurements
4. **Resource efficiency**: Reduces memory and computation overhead

### Usage
The retrieval performance test now:
1. Sets up each system once with appropriate parameters
2. Runs all queries against the same setup
3. Measures both retrieval quality and PIR performance accurately

This matches real-world deployment where a PIR system is set up once and serves many queries.
